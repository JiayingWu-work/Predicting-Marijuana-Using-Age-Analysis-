# Predicting Marijuana Using Age via Smoking Behavior and Educational Backgrounds among Different Age Groups and Genders

## About The Project
In this project, I analyze and understand the incentives and reasons behind marijuana smoking behavior. I also predict the age of starting smoking marijuana and its association with other hidden social and behavioral factors for future reference. It is a final project for Stat155: Statistical Modeling at Macalester College. Please contact Jiaying (jwu4@macalester.edu) for any questions.
